I used the online version of ChatGPT for this assignment, primarily because I had trouble accessing the virtual machine.

### Generating the Story ###
Prompt used to generate story idea: "generate a short story idea for a children's comic that can fit into 12 panels"

The output of this prompt generated the following:
"Story Idea:

Premise: Milo is a shy kid who dreams of being a hero in the Dragon Parade, but he’s too nervous to join. He secretly hopes to meet the real dragon one day, but everyone tells him dragons only come for true heroes. With the encouragement of his little sister Penny and some magical help, he finds the courage to step up and take part.

Plot Outline (12 Panels):

Panel 1: Milo watches from his window as the town gears up for the Dragon Parade, his face a mix of awe and worry. His sister Penny, wearing a makeshift dragon mask, pops up and nudges him to join.

Panel 2: Milo nervously tugs on his own costume—a pair of dragon wings he’s put together. He looks in the mirror, feeling unsure about joining the parade.

Panel 3: Penny cheers him on as they step outside, joining a group of other kids dressed as dragons, knights, and other creatures. Milo smiles a little, feeling braver with Penny by his side.

Panel 4: Suddenly, a gust of wind sweeps through, blowing Milo’s wings right off! Embarrassed, he tries to catch them as they fly through the air.

Panel 5: Chasing his wings, Milo runs through a forested path, with Penny close behind. The wings land on a high branch, just out of his reach.

Panel 6: As he’s about to give up, a shimmering blue dragon—a baby dragon!—appears from behind a tree and grabs the wings, curiously looking at Milo.

Panel 7: Milo and Penny watch in amazement as the dragon, with a playful twinkle, places the wings on Milo’s back and gives him a friendly nod.

Panel 8: Encouraged by the dragon’s silent approval, Milo stands a little taller, feeling proud. Penny cheers, and the dragon nudges him back toward the village.

Panel 9: Milo and Penny race back to the parade, where their friends are thrilled to see them—and even more thrilled to see a real dragon following them.

Panel 10: The villagers gather in awe as the baby dragon joins the parade, playfully swirling around Milo and the other children, adding a touch of real magic to the event.

Panel 11: Milo beams with newfound confidence as he leads the parade, proudly carrying his wings and accompanied by his new dragon friend.

Panel 12: As the sun sets, the dragon gives Milo a final nod, then flies off into the mountains, leaving a trail of sparkles. Milo and Penny smile, knowing they’ve shared in a truly magical adventure.

This story is about courage, friendship, and believing in yourself—even when you feel a little scared. It shows kids that small acts of bravery can lead to big adventures and magical friendships.

### Generating the Images ###
Each panel of the comic was generated by using the prompt "generate an image based on panel {i} using the comic style."
Originally, I did not specify for the images to be in a comic style and so the images that were generated were like weird looking photographs, so I
made sure to specify in the prompt how I wanted the images to look (i.e. like a comic and not a photo).

### Generating an Image Description ###
The prompt I used to generate a description for one of the images was: "generate an image description for the photo you've just generated, describing the image in a way so that a visually impaired person would be able to picture a similar image in their mind." The last image that had been generated was panel 12, so that was the image I wanted a description for.

The generated output was as follows: "The image shows two children, Milo and Penny, walking away from the village parade at sunset. Milo, a young boy with short brown hair, is holding a notebook and a locket in his hands, looking thoughtful yet content. He wears a pair of handmade dragon wings that shimmer softly in the warm, fading light. Beside him, his younger sister Penny, with her hair in pigtails and wearing a playful smile, walks closely, sharing in the peaceful moment.

The background shows the village, fading in the distance, still decorated with colorful banners from the parade. The sky is painted in soft hues of orange, pink, and purple, casting a golden glow over the scene. The ground is a path lined with green grass and a few small flowers, leading away from the festivities. The overall atmosphere feels serene and magical, as the day draws to a close, marking the end of an adventure. The illustration uses bold outlines, vibrant colors, and expressive details to evoke warmth and a sense of quiet joy."
